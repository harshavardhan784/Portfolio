        Modern AI/ML Methods for Healthcare: opportunities and Challenges
    </div>
    <p>
        AI/ML models are used in various domains, and one of the domains is the healthcare sector.AI models have gained enormous popularity over a decade. Artificial intelligence is used in many hospitals to increase their efficiency in Hospital management. Google’s AI algorithm predicts heart disease by looking at users’ eyes. U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved 64 AI/ML algorithms majorly related to cancer. AI-based tools could identify abnormal growths which could be cancerous tumors. The strength of these AI/ML-based algorithms lies in their ability to learn continuously. Algorithm changes are not realized until the device is distributed for use and maybe learned from practical experience. AI can look at massive records and make massive decisions. Doctor availability for needed patients could be improved using AI. One of AI's advantages is that doctors can spend their time with patients where their requirement is necessary. Many considerable changes happened in healthcare because of Artificial intelligence. Often, we come across a good amount of accuracy in ML modes when we feed a large amount of data, but our model may not be accurate in some cases. So, we need to diversify our dataset as much as possible. We need to consider each case. Sometimes, train test data splitting becomes a problem. For example, if we train the ML model only for black people and test for white people, our model may not give accurate results in that case. We could eliminate these problems with techniques such as K-fold cross-validation or categorizing the data and then splitting the data accordingly. ML models could fasten the diagnosis process. People don't trust machines as machines do human work in the healthcare sector. So, ML models need to take care of every case. Therefore, we need to feed large amounts of data for ML/DL models. The future of Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare has many challenges to people's trust, and accuracy for every kind of case as ML models are data-hungry models, a tremendous amount of data is required, and here comes the patient's privacy which is also a challenge.
        There are lots of opportunities in the Healthcare sector.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Identifying patterns in a model is an opportunity based on the observed pattern doctor can identify the severity level of the patient's suffering.
            </li>
            <li>
                We can collect the data on an hourly basis or daily basis, and ML models could analyze the data which helps the doctor more efficiently than the doctor's interrogation with the patient.
            </li>
            <li>
                Smartwatches continuously keep track of a human's heartbeat, if there is any fluctuation observed, it can give an alert to their family members/ hospital.
            </li>
            <li>
                As there is a shortage of doctors and nurses in the health care sector, ML/DL models can replace nurses with an application in which the severity level could be shown to the patient based on the scanned report patient had uploaded/CT scan/radiology. It can be helpful to people in many parts of the world where the healthcare sector is weak. ML models could do many things that replace nurses like pre-diagnosis work
            </li>
            <li>
                Hospitals could analyze data from their previous checkups and alert the patient if there is any severe problem.
            </li>
            <li>
                AI chatbots could save doctors/nurses time by providing minor decision services like cold, cough, etc.

        </ul>
