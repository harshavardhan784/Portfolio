        What's Kooing? Characterizing India's Emerging Social Network, Koo
    </div>
    <p>
        Koo is an Indian microblogging application that provides its social networking service in Indian languages. Koo has competition with various social media platforms but the differentiating factor is Koo supports Indian languages ultimately, it's an Indian-based company. Koo is known as ‘the voice of India’. Some consequences of Koo being well received are:
        <ul>
            <li>
                A step towards Atma Nirbharta.
            </li>
            <li>
                Isolated users could be connected back into the network.
            </li>
        </ul>
        Koo has a lot of opportunities in the future as it's a multi-lingual application that could rapidly increase its user base. Koo is an Indian first problem that focuses on a huge population of 140 CR. People feel comfortable and connected to the network when they are communicated in their regional/ mother tongues. The crucial source of income for social media applications like Koo is ads from the data they have collected. The earnings from the data and ads increase as the user base increases. Koo has many attractive features like editing the post until somebody sees their Koo, etc. Koo could adopt personalized targeting ads via its app once a sufficient amount of data is available (happens when the user base increases). Koo has opened up their algorithm regarding their hashtags, and trending’s. Koo can evolve as an unbiased opinion platform that supports many Indian languages. Koo users can share their opinions in distinct linguistic communities, and celebrate events of regional, and national importance on the platform. Koo promotes localization which is a user's need. Koo can provide a real-time translation of messages across different languages. Koo could increase their users based on localization which promotes Indian languages. As language is one of the most important parts of any culture, people don't hesitate to download the application. Based on the data collected, targeted marketing will increase more opportunities for Koo. User loyalty would increase day by day as it's a multi-lingual app. Koo could introduce paid services like integrated chatbots for business accounts. Koo could easily enter into new markets than other applications because it provides the application in the user's language. The more data collected on user behavior more it can translate into strategic insights. Twitter introduced an $8 charge per month for blue tick verification. Koo doesn’t charge for its yellow tick verification.
        The challenges:
        <ul>
            <li>Language translation would be a big problem for any multi-lingual application.</li>
            <li>Language translation should be culture-specific.</li>
            <li>Languages other than English need more size on the screen (string length).</li>
            <li>Some languages as Arabic have the right to the left script. So, Koo should support both types of scripts.</li>
            </ul>
        Koo provides user incentives for using their application. Koo's most occurring work title and educational qualifications of the users are students. Students being the most common work title Koo could incorporate more innovations, designs, functionalities that could attract students (Avatars, features such as stories or statuses, and features related to face recognition in posts, etc.). Koo needs to improve its graphical user interface to compete with other apps. Koo could work up their recommendation system so that user-to-user interaction increases.
